					THE BEGINNING
					The story of Bacha Coffee begins in the medina of Marrakech, Morocco. Built in 1910, the spectacular
					Dar el Bacha palace,
					which means “house of the Pasha”, united the greatest cultural and political minds of the century
					over glittering pots
					of “coffee of Arabia” or Arabica,
					as it is known today.
					Guests included the writer Colette, composer Maurice Ravel, filmmaker Charlie Chaplin, entertainer
					Josephine Baker,
					US president Franklin Roosevelt and UK prime minister Winston Churchill, to name a few.
				</p>
				<p class="about-section ">
					We deeply love and painfully need coffee – the obvious starting point for our artisan roasting
					adventure in search of exquisite tastes,
					unique flavors, memorable moments. We source some of the finest beans from around the world,
					and we roast them to perfection, aiming to consistently deliver remarkable coffees for
					enthusiasts and professional brewers alike.
				</p>
				<p class="about-section ">We invite you to discover new flavors and aromas,
					to experiment with our single-origin coffees or our designer blends,
					to try new brewing methods. Join our passion for crafting cups of pleasure!
					And enjoy our coffee… the way you like it!

					The way you enjoy your coffee is a unique personal experience, and it doesn’t have anything to do
					with what
					other people or other cultures drink. We know that you already have preferences and routines, but
					don’t let
					that get in the way of trying new things from time to time. And maybe, just maybe, you’ll find
					something worth
					the adventure.
				</p>

				<p class="about-section "> Treat yourself with the best coffee beans you can afford. No matter the
					brewing technique, if you buy lousy coffee
					beans, or if you don’t store them properly, you’ll get a bad cup. Try as many preparing techniques
					as you need – don’t
					stop at the first one! Experiment with a brewing method and tweak it for yourself.
				</p>

				<p class="about-section "> The right way to make it is how you like it best. But that being said,
					acquiring some basics will help you
					perfect your technique. From here, we encourage you to play with different varieties, roasts or
					preparation methods.
					And we share some tips on how to brew a classic cup of coffee.
